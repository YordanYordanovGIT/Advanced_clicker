# Advanced_clicker
An easy-to-use program for clicking automation, autoclicker

It can be used for performing tasks which need many clicks or just for cheating at click-based games.
A friend of mine used it to renew a free Minecraft server every hour by autoclicking at the "I'm not a robot" captcha. How ironic!

Version 1.2

The program is written in .NET and Windows Forms technology is used. If you want to edit and compile the code you only need VS 2017 and up with .NET desktop development pack installed.
