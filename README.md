# Advanced clicker
An easy-to-use program for clicking automation, autoclicker

It can be used for performing tasks which need many clicks or just for cheating at click-based games.
A friend of mine used it to renew a free Minecraft server every hour by autoclicking at the "I'm not a robot" captcha. How ironic!

Version 1.2

The program is written in C# with .NET and Windows Forms technologies being used. If you want to edit and compile the code you only need VS 2017 and up with .NET desktop development pack installed.
